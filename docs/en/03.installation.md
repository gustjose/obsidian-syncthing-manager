## Android Setup (Critical)

To use this plugin on Android (via _Syncthing-Fork_ or the official app), you must allow local HTTP connections.

!!! warning "HTTPS Restriction"
Obsidian Mobile cannot connect to self-signed HTTPS certificates on localhost. You **must disable HTTPS** in the Syncthing App settings. Since the address is restricted to `127.0.0.1`, your traffic remains local and secure.

1. Open Syncthing App > **Settings** > **GUI**.
2. Set **GUI Listen Address** to `127.0.0.1:8384`.
3. **Disable** "Use HTTPS for GUI".
    - _Note: Ensure you have cleared "GUI Authentication User/Password" fields, otherwise the app may enforce HTTPS._
4. Restart the Syncthing App.
5. In Obsidian Plugin Settings, ensure **Use HTTPS** is toggled **OFF**.

### Alternative: Force HTTP (Environment Variable)

If the above method resets or fails, you can force Syncthing to use HTTP using an environment variable.

!!! callout "Side Effect"
This may cause the Syncthing Android App's native UI to stop loading (showing a blank screen or loading spinner). However, the **background service will still run**, and you can access the full Web UI via your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8384`.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Troubleshooting** > **Environment Variables**.
2. Add the following variable:
    - **Key:** `STGUIADDRESS`
    - **Value:** `http://127.0.0.1:8384`
3. Restart the App.
4. If you need to revert, simply delete this variable.
