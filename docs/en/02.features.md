# Features Guide

## Visual Sync

Now you can see exactly what is happening with your files without leaving the editor.

- **Tab Status Icons:** Instant feedback on the file you are editing.
    - 🟠 **Syncing:** Spinning icon indicates the file is being uploaded/downloaded.
    - 🟢 **Synced:** A checkmark appears briefly when synchronization is complete.
- **Smart History:** Know the direction of your data.
    - ↙️ **Incoming:** Changes received from a remote device.
    - ↗️ **Outgoing:** Local changes sent to other devices.

## Conflict Resolution

When a sync conflict occurs, a red alert will appear in the Syncthing View.

1. Click the alert to open the **Conflict Resolver**.
2. Select **Compare Content** for a side-by-side comparison.
3. Choose:
    - **Keep Original:** Deletes the conflict file.
    - **Use Conflict Version:** Overwrites your local file with the remote version.

## Control Center

- **Pause/Resume:** Control specific folders directly from the plugin.
- **Device Status:** See connected devices by name.

## File Versioning

Configure versioning strategies (Trashcan, Simple, Staggered) and **restore previous versions** of files directly within Obsidian.

## Ignoring Files (.stignore)

Prevent layout issues by ignoring workspace configuration files.

1. Open **Settings** > **Syncthing Manager** > **Edit .stignore**.
2. Use "Add Common Patterns" to quickly ignore `workspace.json`, `.obsidian/workspace`, or OS files like `.DS_Store`.

## History Filter

Keep your activity log clean by hiding system files from the history view.
