# Translation Guide

Help us make **Syncthing Manager** accessible to everyone! We welcome contributions for both the plugin interface and the documentation.

## Translating the Plugin

The plugin uses a simple key-value system for localization. To add or update a translation:

1.  Navigate to [`src/lang/locales/`](https://github.com/gustjose/obsidian-syncthing-manager/tree/main/src/lang/locales).
2.  If you want to update an existing language, edit the corresponding `.ts` file (e.g., `pt.ts` for Portuguese).
3.  To add a **new language**:
    - Copy `en.ts` and rename it using the ISO 639-1 code (e.g., `es.ts` for Spanish).
    - Update the translations inside the file.
    - Register the new locale in `src/lang/lang.ts`.

## Translating Documentation

Our documentation is powered by MkDocs and the `mkdocs-static-i18n` plugin.

1.  Navigate to the [`docs/`](https://github.com/gustjose/obsidian-syncthing-manager/tree/main/docs) folder.
2.  Each language has its own subfolder (e.g., `en/`, `pt/`).
3.  To translate a page, copy the `.md` file from the `en/` folder to your language's folder and translate the content.
4.  Maintain the same filename structure (e.g., `02.features.md`) to ensure proper navigation ordering.

## How to Submit

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  Create a new **branch** for your translation (e.g., `translation/spanish`).
3.  Commit your changes.
4.  Open a **Pull Request** (PR) describing the changes.

> [!TIP]
> You don't need to be a programmer to help! Most translation work is just editing text files.
