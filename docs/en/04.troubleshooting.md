# FAQ & Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### The tab icon is spinning but never turns green

This usually means Syncthing is still scanning or the file is large. Check the Syncthing GUI web panel for detailed progress.

### Plugin status shows "Disconnected"

- Verify that the Syncthing service is running.
- Ensure the API Key matches exactly.
- On Android, double-check that HTTPS is disabled in the Syncthing App.

### Is it secure to disable HTTPS on Android?

Yes. By setting the **GUI Listen Address** to `127.0.0.1`, access is restricted exclusively to applications running locally on that specific device.
